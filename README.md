## My process

I coded the mobile version first and then work all the way up to the desktop version. I also worked on the laptop version when I don't have to but I did it anyways because it just doesn't look right.

### Built with

- VS Code Editor
- Google Chrome (Inspect Mode)

### What I learned

- (Desktop Version) Getting the bottom purple buyers card to display next to each other and not to appear in a straight line.
  - Maybe there's a better and easy way to code that. I'll find that one day.
- (Desktop Version) My difficulties was getting the text appear next to the stars and making it different from the mobile version.

### Continued development

- Must learn to make text, image, or any elements appear next to each other without any difficulties. - inline or inline-block
- Really need to learn to center everything in the body element. - Maybe its the problem with the margin. NOT Sure.
